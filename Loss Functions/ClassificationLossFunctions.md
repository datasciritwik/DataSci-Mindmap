# Classification Loss Functions: Interview Cheat Sheet

**Core Idea:** Classification loss functions quantify the discrepancy between the true class labels $(y)$ and the model's predictions $(\hat{y}$ or $\hat{p})$. The model learns by minimizing this loss.

**General Notation:**
*   $N$: Number of samples
*   $C$: Number of classes (for multi-class)
*   $y_i$: True label for the $i$-th sample
*   $\hat{y}_i$: Predicted raw output (logit/score) for the $i$-th sample
*   $\hat{p}_i$: Predicted probability for the $i$-th sample (usually after sigmoid/softmax)

## ðŸ”¹ Binary Classification

Used when there are two possible outcome classes (e.g., 0 or 1, True or False, Spam or Not Spam).

### 1. Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) / Log Loss

*   **True Label Format:** $y \in \{0, 1\}$
*   **Prediction Format:** $\hat{p}$ (probability that sample belongs to class 1, output of a sigmoid function), $0 < \hat{p} < 1$.
*   **Formula (for a single sample):**
    $$ L(y, \hat{p}) = -(y \log(\hat{p}) + (1-y) \log(1-\hat{p})) $$
    The average loss over $N$ samples is $\frac{1}{N} \sum L(y_i, \hat{p}_i)$.
*   **Description:** Measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1. It penalizes confident and wrong predictions heavily.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Standard loss for binary classification with probabilistic outputs.
    *   Smoothly differentiable.
    *   Interpretable as minimizing the negative log-likelihood of the true labels given the predictions.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Can be sensitive to predictions very close to 0 or 1 if they are incorrect (log(0) is undefined, so numerical stability with `epsilon` is important in implementations).
*   **When to Use:**
    *   Default choice for binary classification problems where a probabilistic output is desired (e.g., logistic regression, neural networks with a sigmoid output layer).

### 2. Hinge Loss (used in Support Vector Machines - SVMs)

*   **True Label Format:** $y \in \{-1, 1\}$
*   **Prediction Format:** $\hat{y}$ (raw model output/score, not probability).
*   **Formula (for a single sample):**
    $$ L(y, \hat{y}) = \max(0, 1 - y \cdot \hat{y}) $$
*   **Description:** Primarily used for "maximum-margin" classification, most notably with SVMs. It penalizes predictions that are not only wrong but also not confident enough (i.e., fall within the margin). Correct predictions with $y \cdot \hat{y} \ge 1$ incur zero loss.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Encourages correct classification with a margin.
    *   Less sensitive to outliers than logistic loss because it caps the loss for well-classified points.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Not differentiable at $y \cdot \hat{y} = 1$. Sub-gradients are used.
    *   Does not provide probabilistic outputs directly.
*   **When to Use:**
    *   Training SVMs.
    *   When achieving a large margin between classes is the primary goal.

### 3. Squared Hinge Loss

*   **True Label Format:** $y \in \{-1, 1\}$
*   **Prediction Format:** $\hat{y}$ (raw model output/score).
*   **Formula (for a single sample):**
    $$ L(y, \hat{y}) = (\max(0, 1 - y \cdot \hat{y}))^2 $$
*   **Description:** A squared version of the Hinge Loss.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Smoothly differentiable (unlike Hinge Loss).
    *   Penalizes violations of the margin more heavily than Hinge Loss.
*   **Cons:**
    *   More sensitive to outliers than Hinge Loss due to the squaring.
*   **When to Use:**
    *   As a smoother alternative to Hinge Loss in SVM-like settings.
    *   When a stronger penalty for margin violations is desired.

---

### 4. Focal Loss (for imbalanced datasets)

*   **True Label Format:** $y \in \{0, 1\}$
*   **Prediction Format:** $\hat{p}$ (probability of class 1). Let $p_t = \hat{p}$ if $y=1$, and $p_t = 1-\hat{p}$ if $y=0$.
*   **Formula (for a single sample):**
    $$ L(y, \hat{p}) = -\alpha_t (1-p_t)^\gamma \log(p_t) $$
    *   $\gamma \ge 0$ is the **focusing parameter**.
    *   $\alpha_t$ is a **balancing parameter** (often $\alpha$ for positive class and $1-\alpha$ for negative class).
*   **Description:** An extension of Binary Cross-Entropy. It down-weights the loss assigned to well-classified examples (high $p_t$), focusing training on hard, misclassified examples.
    *   When $\gamma = 0$, it's equivalent to (potentially weighted) Cross-Entropy.
    *   As $\gamma$ increases, the modulating factor $(1-p_t)^\gamma$ reduces the loss for well-classified examples more.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Effectively addresses class imbalance by reducing the contribution of easy negative (or positive) samples.
    *   Allows the model to focus on hard-to-classify examples.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Introduces two new hyperparameters ($\alpha$ and $\gamma$) that need tuning.
*   **When to Use:**
    *   When dealing with highly imbalanced datasets in binary (or multi-class, with modifications) classification, especially in object detection.

## ðŸ”¹ Multi-Class Classification

Used when there are more than two possible outcome classes (e.g., classifying an image as a cat, dog, or bird).

### 1. Categorical Cross-Entropy

*   **True Label Format:** $y$ is a one-hot encoded vector (e.g., `[0, 0, 1]` if class 2 is true out of 3 classes). $y_c = 1$ if $c$ is the true class, $0$ otherwise.
*   **Prediction Format:** $\hat{p}$ is a vector of probabilities for each class (output of a softmax function), where $\sum_{c=1}^{C} \hat{p}_c = 1$. $\hat{p}_c$ is the predicted probability for class $c$.
*   **Formula (for a single sample):**
    $$ L(y, \hat{p}) = - \sum_{c=1}^{C} y_c \log(\hat{p}_c) $$
    Since $y$ is one-hot, only the term for the true class contributes: $L(y, \hat{p}) = - \log(\hat{p}_{\text{true_class}})$.
*   **Description:** The standard loss function for multi-class classification problems where classes are mutually exclusive.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Standard and effective for multi-class problems with probabilistic outputs.
    *   Smoothly differentiable.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Requires labels to be one-hot encoded, which can be memory intensive for a very large number of classes (see Sparse CCE).
*   **When to Use:**
    *   Default choice for multi-class classification with neural networks (using a softmax output layer).

---

### 2. Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy

*   **True Label Format:** $y$ is an integer representing the class index (e.g., `2` if class 2 is true).
*   **Prediction Format:** $\hat{p}$ is a vector of probabilities for each class (output of a softmax function), $\sum_{c=1}^{C} \hat{p}_c = 1$.
*   **Formula (for a single sample):**
    $$ L(y, \hat{p}) = - \log(\hat{p}_y) $$
    Where $\hat{p}_y$ is the predicted probability of the true class index $y$.
*   **Description:** Mathematically the same as Categorical Cross-Entropy but handles integer targets directly, avoiding explicit one-hot encoding.
*   **Pros:**
    *   More convenient and memory-efficient when dealing with a large number of classes, as it doesn't require one-hot encoding of labels.
*   **Cons:**
    *   None significant compared to CCE if integer labels are preferred.
*   **When to Use:**
    *   Same as Categorical Cross-Entropy, but when your true labels are integers (e.g., 0, 1, 2, ...) instead of one-hot vectors.

### 3. Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence

*   **True Label Format:** $P$ is a true probability distribution over classes.
*   **Prediction Format:** $Q$ is the model's predicted probability distribution over classes (e.g., output of softmax).
*   **Formula:**
    $$ D_{KL}(P || Q) = \sum_{c=1}^{C} P(c) \log\left(\frac{P(c)}{Q(c)}\right) $$
    Can also be written as: $D_{KL}(P || Q) = \sum P(c) \log P(c) - \sum P(c) \log Q(c)$.
    The first term is the entropy of $P$. If $P$ is a one-hot encoded target distribution ($P(c)=y_c$), then $\sum y_c \log y_c = 0$ (since $0\log0=0, 1\log1=0$). In this case, KL Divergence becomes equivalent to Categorical Cross-Entropy: $-\sum y_c \log Q(c)$.
*   **Description:** Measures how one probability distribution ($Q$) diverges from a second, expected probability distribution ($P$).
*   **Pros:**
    *   General form allows for soft labels or target distributions.
    *   Fundamental concept in information theory.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Asymmetric: $D_{KL}(P || Q) \neq D_{KL}(Q || P)$.
    *   Requires $Q(c) > 0$ where $P(c) > 0$.
*   **When to Use:**
    *   When the true labels are themselves a probability distribution (not just a single class).
    *   In VAEs (Variational Autoencoders) to measure divergence between latent distributions.
    *   As a generalization of cross-entropy when targets are soft.

---

### 4. Label Smoothing Cross-Entropy

*   **True Label Format:** Modified one-hot encoded vector $y'$. For true class $k$:
    $y'_c = (1-\epsilon)$ if $c=k$, and $y'_c = \epsilon / (C-1)$ if $c \neq k$ (for $C$ classes).
    Alternatively, simpler: $y'_c = y_c(1-\epsilon) + \epsilon/C$.
*   **Prediction Format:** $\hat{p}$ is a vector of probabilities (output of softmax).
*   **Formula (using the second $y'$ definition):**
    $$ L(y', \hat{p}) = - \sum_{c=1}^{C} \left( y_c(1-\epsilon) + \frac{\epsilon}{C} \right) \log(\hat{p}_c) $$
    where $\epsilon$ is a small smoothing factor (e.g., 0.1).
*   **Description:** A regularization technique that prevents the model from becoming too confident about its predictions. Instead of aiming for a probability of 1 for the true class and 0 for others, it encourages the model to assign a small probability mass $\epsilon/C$ to incorrect classes.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Acts as a regularizer, improving model generalization and calibration.
    *   Reduces overconfidence and can prevent large gradients from very confident wrong predictions.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Introduces a hyperparameter $\epsilon$.
    *   May slightly hurt performance on the training set (as it's not trying to achieve "perfect" scores).
*   **When to Use:**
    *   In deep neural networks to improve generalization and reduce overconfidence, especially when the dataset is noisy or model capacity is high.

## Key Takeaways for Interviews:

*   **Probabilistic vs. Margin-based:**
    *   **Cross-Entropy variants (BCE, CCE, Sparse CCE):** For models outputting probabilities (sigmoid/softmax). Penalize based on how "off" the probability is.
    *   **Hinge Loss variants:** For margin-based classifiers like SVMs. Focus on correct classification with a confident margin.
*   **Handling Imbalance:**
    *   **Focal Loss:** Specifically designed to address class imbalance by down-weighting easy examples.
    *   Weighted versions of cross-entropy are also common.
*   **Label Format:**
    *   **Categorical Cross-Entropy:** Requires one-hot encoded labels.
    *   **Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy:** Uses integer labels, more convenient for many classes.
*   **Regularization & Advanced:**
    *   **Label Smoothing:** Regularizes by preventing overconfidence.
    *   **KL Divergence:** More general; useful when true labels are distributions.
*   **Understand the "Why":** Be ready to explain *why* you'd choose one over another (e.g., "If I have severe class imbalance, I'd consider Focal Loss or weighted cross-entropy because...").

Good luck!
