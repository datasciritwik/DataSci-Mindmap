# Reinforcement Learning (RL) Losses: Interview Cheat Sheet

**Core Idea:** RL agents learn by interacting with an environment to maximize a cumulative reward signal. Loss functions in Deep RL are used to update the parameters of neural networks representing the agent's policy (what action to take) and/or value functions (how good a state or state-action pair is).

**General Notation:**
*   $s, s_t$: State
*   $a, a_t$: Action
*   $r, r_t$: Reward
*   $\pi_\theta(a|s)$: Policy (probability of taking action $a$ in state $s$) parameterized by $\theta$.
*   $V_\phi(s)$: State-value function (expected return from state $s$) parameterized by $\phi$.
*   $Q_\phi(s,a)$: Action-value function (expected return from state $s$ after taking action $a$) parameterized by $\phi$.
*   $G_t = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k r_{t+k+1}$: The return (discounted sum of future rewards) from time $t$.
*   $\hat{A}_t$: An estimate of the advantage function $A(s_t, a_t) = Q(s_t, a_t) - V(s_t)$. Often $\hat{A}_t = G_t - V_\phi(s_t)$ or based on TD error.
*   $\gamma \in [0,1]$: Discount factor.
*   $\alpha$: Learning rate.
*   $\epsilon$: Clipping parameter (for PPO).
*   $H(\pi(s))$: Entropy of the policy $\pi$ at state $s$.

## 1. Policy Gradient Loss (e.g., REINFORCE)

*   **Goal:** Directly update the policy parameters $\theta$ to increase the probability of actions leading to higher returns (or advantages).
*   **Algorithm Context:** REINFORCE, A2C/A3C (actor part).
*   **Formula (Objective is to MAXIMIZE $J(\theta)$, so LOSS is NEGATIVE of this for gradient descent):**
    $$ L_{PG}(\theta) = -\mathbb{E}_t [\log \pi_\theta(a_t|s_t) \cdot \hat{A}_t] $$
    (Sometimes $G_t$ is used instead of $\hat{A}_t$, especially in basic REINFORCE).
*   **Description:**
    *   $\log \pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)$: Log-probability of the action taken. Its gradient $\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)$ indicates how to change $\theta$ to increase/decrease this probability.
    *   $\hat{A}_t$: Weights the update. If $\hat{A}_t > 0$ (action better than average), increase $\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)$. If $\hat{A}_t < 0$ (action worse than average), decrease $\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)$.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Directly optimizes the policy.
    *   Works for continuous action spaces.
*   **Cons:**
    *   High variance in gradients, leading to slow or unstable learning. Using a baseline (like $V(s)$ to form $\hat{A}_t$) helps reduce variance.
*   **When to Discuss:** Fundamental policy optimization method. Explain how it directly follows the policy gradient theorem.

## 2. Value Function Loss (e.g., MSE for TD Learning)

*   **Goal:** Train a value function approximator ($V_\phi(s)$ or $Q_\phi(s,a)$) to accurately predict the expected return.
*   **Algorithm Context:** Q-Learning, SARSA, DQN (for $Q_\phi$), A2C/A3C (critic part for $V_\phi$).
*   **Formula (for State-Value Function $V_\phi(s)$ using Temporal Difference target):**
    $$ L_V(\phi) = \mathbb{E}_t [( (r_{t+1} + \gamma V_\phi(s_{t+1})) - V_\phi(s_t) )^2] $$
    (This is Mean Squared Error of the TD error: $\delta_t = r_{t+1} + \gamma V_\phi(s_{t+1}) - V_\phi(s_t)$).
    More generally, can be target $Y_t$ (e.g., Monte Carlo return $G_t$ or TD target):
    $$ L_V(\phi) = \mathbb{E}_t [(Y_t - V_\phi(s_t))^2] $$
    For Action-Value Function $Q_\phi(s,a)$ (e.g., DQN):
    $$ L_Q(\phi) = \mathbb{E}_{(s_t, a_t, r_{t+1}, s_{t+1})} [( (r_{t+1} + \gamma \max_{a'} Q_{\phi_{target}}(s_{t+1}, a')) - Q_\phi(s_t, a_t) )^2] $$
    (Often uses a target network $\phi_{target}$ for stability). Huber loss (Smooth L1) is also commonly used instead of MSE.
*   **Description:** A supervised learning problem where the network learns to predict the target value (estimated return).
*   **Pros:**
    *   Learning value functions is crucial for many algorithms (e.g., for TD learning, as a baseline for policy gradients, for Q-learning).
*   **Cons:**
    *   Can be biased if the function approximator isn't powerful enough or if bootstrapping from inaccurate estimates.
*   **When to Discuss:** Core of value-based methods and the critic in actor-critic methods.

## 3. Actor-Critic Loss

*   **Goal:** Combine the benefits of policy-based (actor) and value-based (critic) methods. The critic learns a value function, and the actor updates the policy in directions suggested by the critic.
*   **Algorithm Context:** A2C/A3C, DDPG, SAC, TD3.
*   **Formulation (typically a combined loss, optimized jointly or alternatingly):**
    1.  **Actor Loss (Policy Gradient):**
        $$ L_{Actor}(\theta) = -\mathbb{E}_t [\log \pi_\theta(a_t|s_t) \cdot \hat{A}_t^{\text{critic}} + \beta H(\pi_\theta(s_t))] $$
        (Where $\hat{A}_t^{\text{critic}}$ is the advantage estimated using the critic, e.g., $Q_\phi(s_t,a_t) - V_\phi(s_t)$ or $r_{t+1} + \gamma V_\phi(s_{t+1}) - V_\phi(s_t)$. $\beta H(\pi_\theta(s_t))$ is an optional entropy bonus to encourage exploration).
        For deterministic policies (e.g., DDPG), $L_{Actor}(\theta) = -\mathbb{E}_t [Q_\phi(s_t, \pi_\theta(s_t))]$.
    2.  **Critic Loss (Value Function Loss):**
        $$ L_{Critic}(\phi) = \mathbb{E}_t [(Y_t - V_\phi(s_t))^2] \quad \text{or} \quad \mathbb{E}_t [(Y_t - Q_\phi(s_t,a_t))^2] $$
        (Where $Y_t$ is the target, e.g., $r_{t+1} + \gamma V_\phi(s_{t+1})$ or $r_{t+1} + \gamma Q_{\phi_{target}}(s_{t+1}, a'_{target})$).
*   **Description:** The critic estimates the value of states/actions, reducing variance for the actor's policy gradient updates. The actor learns to take actions that the critic deems good.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Lower variance than pure policy gradient methods.
    *   Can learn efficiently in complex environments.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Interaction between actor and critic can be complex; sensitive to hyperparameter tuning.
*   **When to Discuss:** A dominant paradigm in modern DRL, combining strengths of both approaches.

## 4. PPO Loss (Clipped Surrogate Objective)

*   **Goal:** Achieve stable policy updates by constraining the change in the policy at each step, preventing performance collapse from overly large updates.
*   **Algorithm Context:** Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
*   **Key Component - Probability Ratio:**
    $$ r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(a_t|s_t)} $$
    (Ratio of probabilities of action $a_t$ under current policy $\pi_\theta$ and old policy $\pi_{\theta_{old}}$ used to collect data).
*   **Formula (Clipped Surrogate Objective - to be MAXIMIZED, so LOSS is NEGATIVE):**
    $$ L^{CLIP}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_t [\min(r_t(\theta) \hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon) \hat{A}_t)] $$
    *   $r_t(\theta) \hat{A}_t$: Standard policy gradient objective (unclipped).
    *   $\text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon) \hat{A}_t$: Clipped version. $r_t(\theta)$ is prevented from moving too far from 1 (i.e., new policy too different from old). $\epsilon$ is a small hyperparameter (e.g., 0.1 or 0.2).
    *   The $\min$ ensures we take the pessimistic bound, discouraging large policy changes.
*   **Full PPO Loss (typically optimized):**
    $$ L_{PPO}(\theta, \phi) = \mathbb{E}_t [-L^{CLIP}(\theta) + c_1 L_{VF}(\phi) - c_2 H(\pi_\theta(s_t))] $$
    *   $L_{VF}(\phi)$: Value function loss (e.g., MSE: $(G_t - V_\phi(s_t))^2$) for the critic. $c_1$ is a weight.
    *   $H(\pi_\theta(s_t))$: Entropy bonus for exploration. $c_2$ is a weight.
*   **Description:** PPO tries to optimize the policy within a "trust region" around the old policy, defined implicitly by the clipping mechanism. This makes updates more conservative and stable.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Simpler to implement and tune than TRPO (another trust region method).
    *   Achieves state-of-the-art performance on many benchmarks.
    *   Relatively robust and sample efficient for an on-policy method.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Introduces hyperparameter $\epsilon$ (clipping range).
*   **When to Discuss:** A leading on-policy algorithm. Explain the motivation for clipping and how it helps stabilize training compared to vanilla policy gradients.

## Key Takeaways for Interviews:

*   **Objective:** RL losses aim to update policy parameters to maximize expected return and/or train value functions to accurately estimate returns.
*   **Policy Gradients:** Directly optimize the policy. High variance is a key challenge, addressed by baselines (value functions).
*   **Value Function Learning:** Supervised learning problem to predict future rewards. Can suffer from bias. Target networks and careful target construction (e.g., TD target, Monte Carlo return) are important.
*   **Actor-Critic:** A powerful hybrid, using a critic (value function) to guide and stabilize the learning of an actor (policy).
*   **Stability (PPO):** Techniques like clipping in PPO are crucial for preventing destructive large policy updates, leading to more stable and reliable learning.
*   **Exploration vs. Exploitation:** Entropy bonus terms are often added to policy losses to encourage exploration.

Good luck!
