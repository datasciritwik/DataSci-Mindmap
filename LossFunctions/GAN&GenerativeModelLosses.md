# GAN & Generative Model Losses: Interview Cheat Sheet

**Core Idea:** Generative models learn to create new data samples that resemble a training dataset. Their loss functions guide this learning process, often involving a competition (GANs) or by optimizing likelihood and latent space structure (VAEs).

**General Notation:**
*   $G$: Generator network
*   $D$: Discriminator network (or Critic in WGAN)
*   $x$: Real data sample from $p_{data}(x)$
*   $z$: Latent noise vector from prior $p_z(z)$ (e.g., Gaussian)
*   $G(z)$: Generated (fake) data sample
*   $D(x)$: Discriminator's output probability that $x$ is real
*   $D(G(z))$: Discriminator's output probability that $G(z)$ is real
*   $\mathbb{E}$: Expectation

## 1. Adversarial Loss (Minimax GAN Loss)

*   **Goal:** Train $G$ to produce realistic data that fools $D$, while $D$ learns to distinguish real data from $G$'s fakes.
*   **Formulation (Original GAN):**
    $$ \min_G \max_D V(D,G) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}(x)}[\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)}[\log(1 - D(G(z)))] $$
*   **Discriminator's Loss ($L_D$ - aims to maximize $V$):**
    $$ L_D = - (\mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}(x)}[\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)}[\log(1 - D(G(z)))]) $$
    (Train $D$ to assign high probability to real, low to fake)
*   **Generator's Loss ($L_G$ - aims to minimize $V$):**
    *   **Original Minimax Version:** $L_G = \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)}[\log(1 - D(G(z)))]$ (Minimize probability of $D$ correctly identifying fakes)
        *   *Problem:* Can saturate (vanishing gradients) early in training when $D$ is strong.
    *   **Non-Saturating Version (more common in practice):**
        $$ L_G = - \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)}[\log D(G(z))] $$
        (Train $G$ to maximize the probability of $D$ incorrectly identifying fakes as real)
*   **Description:** A zero-sum game. $D$ learns to be a good classifier. $G$ learns to generate samples that $D$ classifies as real.
*   **Pros:**
    *   The foundational GAN loss.
    *   Can generate sharp, high-quality samples.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Training can be unstable (e.g., mode collapse, vanishing gradients for G with the original $L_G$).
    *   Difficult to evaluate convergence.
*   **When to Use:** Baseline for many GAN architectures. The non-saturating $L_G$ is standard.

## 2. Feature Matching Loss (GAN)

*   **Goal:** Improve GAN stability by having the generator produce fake samples whose features (from an intermediate layer of the discriminator) match the features of real samples.
*   **Formula:**
    $$ L_{FM} = \| \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}(x)} [f_D(x)] - \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)} [f_D(G(z))] \|_2^2 $$
    where $f_D(\cdot)$ denotes activations from an intermediate layer of the discriminator $D$.
*   **Description:** Instead of $G$ just trying to fool $D$'s final output, $G$ tries to make the statistical properties of its generated features match those of real data features.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Can stabilize GAN training.
    *   May help prevent mode collapse by encouraging feature diversity.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Choosing the appropriate layer in $D$ for $f_D$ can be heuristic.
    *   Adds some complexity to the loss.
*   **When to Use:** To improve training stability and sample diversity in GANs, often used in conjunction with the adversarial loss.

## 3. Wasserstein Loss (WGAN & WGAN-GP)

*   **Goal:** Minimize the Earth Mover's Distance (Wasserstein-1 distance) between the real data distribution $p_{data}$ and the generated data distribution $p_g$.
*   **Key Change:** Discriminator ($D$) is replaced by a Critic ($C$) that outputs a scalar score (not a probability). $C$ must be K-Lipschitz continuous.
*   **Critic's Loss ($L_C$ - aims to maximize the difference):**
    $$ L_C = \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)}[C(G(z))] - \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}(x)}[C(x)] $$
    (Minimize the negative of this for gradient descent).
*   **Generator's Loss ($L_G$):**
    $$ L_G = - \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)}[C(G(z))] $$
*   **Lipschitz Constraint Enforcement:**
    *   **WGAN:** Weight clipping on $C$'s weights to a small range (e.g., [-0.01, 0.01]).
    *   **WGAN-GP (Gradient Penalty):** Add a penalty term to $L_C$:
        $$ L_{GP} = \lambda \mathbb{E}_{\hat{x} \sim p_{\hat{x}}(\hat{x})} [ (\| \nabla_{\hat{x}} C(\hat{x}) \|_2 - 1)^2 ] $$
        where $\hat{x}$ are samples interpolated between real and fake data: $\hat{x} = \epsilon x + (1-\epsilon)G(z)$ with $\epsilon \sim U[0,1]$.
*   **Description:** WGAN provides a smoother, more meaningful loss metric that correlates with sample quality.
*   **Pros:**
    *   More stable training dynamics than standard GANs.
    *   Reduces mode collapse significantly.
    *   The critic's loss is a more meaningful measure of sample quality/training progress.
    *   WGAN-GP avoids issues with weight clipping (capacity reduction, gradient issues).
*   **Cons:**
    *   WGAN (with weight clipping) can be sensitive to clipping hyperparameter, may lead to vanishing/exploding gradients if not tuned well.
    *   WGAN-GP is computationally more expensive due to gradient penalty calculation.
*   **When to Use:** When standard GAN training is unstable, mode collapse is severe, or a more reliable measure of generation quality during training is needed. WGAN-GP is generally preferred over original WGAN.

## 4. KL Divergence (in Variational Autoencoders - VAEs)

*   **Goal (within VAEs):** Regularize the encoder by forcing the learned latent distribution $q(z|x)$ (posterior approximation) to be close to a prior distribution $p(z)$ (typically a standard Gaussian $\mathcal{N}(0, I)$).
*   **Context:** VAEs maximize the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO):
    $$ \text{ELBO} = \mathbb{E}_{q(z|x)}[\log p(x|z)] - D_{KL}(q(z|x) || p(z)) $$
    The KL Divergence term is the loss component discussed here. We want to *minimize* this KL divergence as part of minimizing the negative ELBO.
*   **Formula (for $q(z|x) = \mathcal{N}(\mu(x), \text{diag}(\sigma^2(x)))$ and $p(z) = \mathcal{N}(0,I)$):**
    $$ L_{KL} = D_{KL}(q(z|x) || p(z)) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j=1}^{J} (\mu_j(x)^2 + \sigma_j(x)^2 - \log(\sigma_j(x)^2) - 1) $$
    where $J$ is the dimensionality of the latent space $z$, and $\mu(x), \sigma(x)$ are outputs of the encoder.
*   **Description:** This term acts as a regularizer on the latent space, encouraging it to be smooth and continuous, allowing for meaningful interpolation and generation from $p(z)$.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Enables generative capabilities by structuring the latent space.
    *   Provides a principled way (probabilistic) to learn latent representations.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Can lead to "posterior collapse" if its weight is too high (encoder ignores input $x$, $q(z|x)$ becomes $p(z)$).
    *   Often leads to somewhat blurrier reconstructions compared to standard AEs or GANs, as it's a trade-off with the reconstruction loss.
*   **When to Use:** A core component of the VAE loss function.

## 5. Reconstruction Loss (for Autoencoders, VAEs, etc.)

*   **Goal:** Ensure that the output of the decoder ($\hat{x} = G(\text{encoder}(x))$ or $p(x|z)$ in VAEs) is as close as possible to the original input $x$.
*   **Common Forms:**
    *   **Mean Squared Error (MSE) / L2 Loss:** For real-valued data (e.g., natural images, audio features).
        $$ L_{recon} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \|x_i - \hat{x}_i\|_2^2 $$
    *   **Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE):** For binary data (e.g., MNIST pixels treated as binary) or data normalized to [0,1] representing probabilities.
        $$ L_{recon} = - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{D} (x_{ij} \log(\hat{x}_{ij}) + (1-x_{ij}) \log(1-\hat{x}_{ij})) $$
        (summed over pixels/features $j$ and samples $i$)
*   **Description:** Measures the fidelity of the autoencoder's ability to reconstruct its input after passing it through the bottleneck latent space.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Directly encourages the learning of useful representations for data compression/reconstruction.
    *   Simple and effective for many data types.
*   **Cons:**
    *   MSE can lead to blurry reconstructions for complex data like natural images.
    *   On its own (without e.g. KL divergence in VAEs), doesn't guarantee good generative properties or a well-structured latent space.
*   **When to Use:** Fundamental loss term for all types of autoencoders (standard AEs, Denoising AEs, VAEs). The choice between MSE and BCE depends on the nature of the input/output data.

## Key Takeaways for Interviews:

*   **GANs (Adversarial, Feature Matching, Wasserstein):**
    *   Understand the **minimax game** and the roles of Generator and Discriminator/Critic.
    *   Be aware of **training instabilities** (mode collapse, vanishing gradients) and how different losses (WGAN, non-saturating loss) try to address them.
    *   WGAN provides a more **meaningful loss metric** related to sample quality. WGAN-GP is the preferred way to enforce Lipschitz.
*   **VAEs (KL Divergence, Reconstruction Loss):**
    *   Understand the **ELBO** and the trade-off between reconstruction fidelity ($L_{recon}$) and latent space regularization ($L_{KL}$).
    *   The KL term encourages a **smooth, continuous latent space** suitable for generation.
*   **General:**
    *   Be ready to explain **why** one loss might be chosen over another for a specific problem or to address certain training issues.
    *   The choice of loss is deeply tied to the model architecture and the desired properties of the generated samples or learned representations.

Good luck!
