# Ranking / Learning-to-Rank (LTR) Loss Functions: Interview Cheat Sheet

**Core Idea:** LTR loss functions are designed to train models that can accurately order a set of items (e.g., documents, products, recommendations) based on their relevance to a query or user preference. They differ based on whether they consider individual items (pointwise - covered under regression/classification), pairs of items (pairwise), or entire lists of items (listwise).

**General Notation:**
*   $q$: Query
*   $d_i, d_j, d_k$: Documents or items
*   $f(d)$: Embedding vector for document $d$
*   $s(q, d)$ or $s(d)$: Predicted relevance score of document $d$ for query $q$ (or context)
*   $y_i$: True relevance label for $d_i$ (can be graded or binary)
*   $y_{ij} \in \{+1, -1\}$: Indicates if $d_i$ is preferred over $d_j$ ($+1$) or vice-versa ($-1$)
*   $\mathcal{D}(f(d_i), f(d_j))$: Distance between embeddings, e.g., $\|f(d_i) - f(d_j)\|_2^2$
*   $m$: Margin hyperparameter
*   $\pi$: A permutation (ranked list) of items
*   $\sigma(\cdot)$: Sigmoid function

## I. Pairwise Losses (Focus on relative order of two items)

These losses consider pairs of items and try to ensure that a more relevant item is scored higher than a less relevant item.

### 1. Contrastive Loss

*   **Goal:** Learn embeddings such that similar/positive pairs are close together in the embedding space, and dissimilar/negative pairs are far apart by at least a margin $m$.
*   **Input:** Pairs of items $(d_i, d_j)$ and a label $Y \in \{0, 1\}$. $Y=0$ if $d_i, d_j$ are similar (positive pair), $Y=1$ if dissimilar (negative pair).
*   **Formula (for one pair):**
    $$ L(d_i, d_j, Y) = (1-Y) \cdot \frac{1}{2} \mathcal{D}(f(d_i), f(d_j)) + Y \cdot \frac{1}{2} \max(0, m - \sqrt{\mathcal{D}(f(d_i), f(d_j))})^2 $$
    (Often the squared distance $\mathcal{D}$ is used directly in the second term without the sqrt if $\mathcal{D}$ is already squared distance.)
    Simplified for clarity, using squared Euclidean distance $D_{ij}^2 = \|f(d_i) - f(d_j)\|_2^2$:
    $$ L = (1-Y) \frac{1}{2} D_{ij}^2 + Y \frac{1}{2} \max(0, m^2 - D_{ij}^2) $$
    (Note: Many slight variations exist, e.g. $m-D_{ij}$ if $D_{ij}$ is not squared. Ensure $m$ has compatible units with distance.)
*   **Description:**
    *   If $Y=0$ (similar pair): Loss is $\frac{1}{2} D_{ij}^2$. Pushes $f(d_i)$ and $f(d_j)$ together.
    *   If $Y=1$ (dissimilar pair): Loss is $\frac{1}{2} \max(0, m - D_{ij})^2$ (using $D_{ij}$ as distance). Pushes $D_{ij}$ to be greater than $m$.
*   **Pros:** Good for learning similarity embeddings from pairs.
*   **Cons:** Requires defining "similar" vs "dissimilar" pairs and tuning margin $m$. Performance depends on sampling strategy for pairs.
*   **When to Use:** Metric learning, face verification, learning item similarity for recommendations (e.g., "users who bought X also bought Y").

### 2. Triplet Loss

*   **Goal:** Ensure an "anchor" item $(A)$ is closer to a "positive" item $(P)$ (similar to $A$) than to a "negative" item $(N)$ (dissimilar to $A$), by at least a margin $m$.
*   **Input:** Triplets $(A, P, N)$.
*   **Formula (for one triplet, using squared Euclidean distance):**
    $$ L(A, P, N) = \max(0, \|f(A) - f(P)\|_2^2 - \|f(A) - f(N)\|_2^2 + m) $$
*   **Description:** Penalizes if $dist(A,P) + m > dist(A,N)$. Aims to make $dist(A,N) > dist(A,P) + m$.
*   **Pros:** Focuses on relative distances, often more effective than contrastive loss for ranking as it directly optimizes a relative order constraint.
*   **Cons:** Triplet selection (mining) is crucial and can be hard (need "hard" triplets where $N$ is close to $A$). Margin $m$ needs tuning.
*   **When to Use:** Image retrieval, face recognition, person re-identification, item recommendation where relative similarity is key.

### 3. Pairwise Hinge Loss (Margin Ranking Loss)

*   **Goal:** Ensure that a preferred item $d_i$ has a higher relevance score $s(d_i)$ than a less preferred item $d_j$ by at least a margin $m$.
*   **Input:** Pairs of items $(d_i, d_j)$ where preference is known. Let $y_{ij} = +1$ if $d_i$ is preferred over $d_j$.
*   **Formula (for one pair $(d_i, d_j)$ where $d_i$ is preferred):**
    $$ L(d_i, d_j) = \max(0, m - (s(d_i) - s(d_j))) $$
    (We want $s(d_i) - s(d_j) > m$).
    More general form with $y_{ij} \in \{+1, -1\}$:
    $$ L(d_i, d_j, y_{ij}) = \max(0, m - y_{ij} \cdot (s(d_i) - s(d_j))) $$
*   **Description:** If the score of the preferred item is not higher than the score of the less preferred item by at least $m$, a loss is incurred.
*   **Pros:** Directly optimizes for pairwise ranking preferences. Widely used in LTR.
*   **Cons:** Ignores the global list structure. Number of pairs can be large ($O(N^2)$). Margin $m$ needs tuning.
*   **When to Use:** Search result ranking, recommendation systems, any task where relative ordering of pairs from scores is important. A core component of many SVM-based LTR methods like RankSVM.

## II. Listwise Losses (Focus on the entire ranked list)

These losses evaluate and optimize based on the entire list of items for a given query.

### 1. ListNet Loss

*   **Goal:** Minimize the divergence (e.g., Cross-Entropy) between the probability distribution of items being top-ranked derived from true relevance scores and the one derived from predicted scores.
*   **Input:** For each query $q$, a list of items $D_q = \{d_1, ..., d_n\}$ with true relevance scores $Y_q = \{y_1, ..., y_n\}$ and predicted scores $S_q = \{s_1, ..., s_n\}$.
*   **Top-one Probability (using Softmax):**
    For a list of scores $Z = \{z_1, ..., z_n\}$, $P_Z(j) = \frac{\exp(z_j)}{\sum_{k=1}^{n} \exp(z_k)}$
*   **Formula (Cross-Entropy):**
    $$ L(Y_q, S_q) = - \sum_{j=1}^{n} P_{Y_q}(j) \log(P_{S_q}(j)) $$
*   **Description:** Treats ranking as predicting the probability of each item being the top one in the list. The "true" probabilities are derived from ground truth relevance labels (e.g., scaled click counts or editorially assigned relevance scores).
*   **Pros:** Considers the entire list permutation probabilities in a smooth and differentiable way. Probabilistically sound.
*   **Cons:** Focuses on the "top-one" probability for each item's position in the permutation, not directly on other aspects of ranking quality like NDCG. The ground truth probabilities $P_{Y_q}(j)$ can be heuristic.
*   **When to Use:** When a probabilistic, list-aware loss is desired. Often a building block for more advanced methods.

### 2. ListMLE Loss (Maximum Likelihood Estimation)

*   **Goal:** Maximize the likelihood of observing the true permutation (ranking order) of items given the predicted scores, typically using the Plackett-Luce model for permutations.
*   **Input:** For each query $q$, a list of items $D_q$ and their true permutation $\pi_q = (\pi_1, ..., \pi_n)$ based on relevance (where $\pi_j$ is the item at rank $j$). Predicted scores $S_q = \{s_{\pi_1}, ..., s_{\pi_n}\}$.
*   **Probability of permutation $\pi_q$ given scores $S_q$ (Plackett-Luce):**
    $$ P(\pi_q | S_q) = \prod_{j=1}^{n} \frac{\exp(s_{\pi_j})}{\sum_{k=j}^{n} \exp(s_{\pi_k})} $$
    (This is the probability of picking $\pi_1$ from all items, then $\pi_2$ from remaining, etc.)
*   **Formula (Negative Log-Likelihood):**
    $$ L(\pi_q, S_q) = - \log P(\pi_q | S_q) = - \sum_{j=1}^{n} \left( s_{\pi_j} - \log \sum_{k=j}^{n} \exp(s_{\pi_k}) \right) $$
*   **Description:** Aims to find scores $S_q$ that make the ground truth permutation $\pi_q$ most probable.
*   **Pros:** Strong theoretical basis (MLE), directly models permutations, often robust.
*   **Cons:** Computationally more intensive for very long lists. Assumes Plackett-Luce model for choice probability.
*   **When to Use:** When a robust listwise approach is desired for accurately predicting the full ranked order.

## III. Metric-Driven Approaches (Directly or indirectly optimizing ranking metrics)

These methods aim to optimize non-differentiable ranking metrics like NDCG or MAP.

### 1. NDCG Loss (and similar metric-driven approaches like LambdaRank)

*   **NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain):** A popular listwise ranking metric that gives higher weight to relevant items at top positions.
    $DCG_k = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{2^{rel_i}-1}{\log_2(i+1)}$, $NDCG_k = \frac{DCG_k}{IDCG_k}$ (IDCG is DCG of ideal ranking).
*   **Goal:** Directly or indirectly optimize NDCG (or other ranking metrics).
*   **Challenge:** NDCG is non-differentiable and non-continuous with respect to model scores.
*   **Common Approach (e.g., LambdaRank, LambdaMART):**
    *   Not a "loss function" in the traditional sense but a method to define gradients.
    *   Uses a pairwise loss framework (e.g., logistic loss or hinge loss) but modifies the gradients ("lambdas") based on the change in NDCG (or other metric) when a pair of items $(d_i, d_j)$ is swapped.
    *   **Lambda Gradients:** For a pair $(d_i, d_j)$ where $d_i$ is more relevant than $d_j$:
        $$ \lambda_{ij} = -\frac{\partial L}{\partial s_i} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial s_j} = \sigma'(s_i - s_j) \cdot |\Delta NDCG_{ij}| $$
        where $\sigma'$ is derivative of sigmoid, and $\Delta NDCG_{ij}$ is the change in NDCG from swapping $d_i$ and $d_j$. The model updates scores $s_i$ and $s_j$ based on these $\lambda_{ij}$.
*   **Other Approaches (Approximate NDCG, SoftRank):**
    *   Use differentiable approximations of ranking metrics or the ranking process itself.
    *   E.g., Gumbel-Softmax trick to sample permutations differentiably, then compute expected NDCG.
*   **Pros:** Can directly optimize for the metric of interest, often leading to state-of-the-art performance on that metric. LambdaRank is widely used and effective.
*   **Cons:** Can be more complex to implement. The "loss" is implicit in the gradient definition for LambdaRank. Approximations in other methods might not be perfect.
*   **When to Use:** Critical when evaluation is primarily based on NDCG, MAP, ERR, etc. Common in search engines and large-scale recommendation systems.

## Key Takeaways for Interviews:

*   **Pairwise vs. Listwise:**
    *   **Pairwise (Contrastive, Triplet, Pairwise Hinge):** Focus on relative order of two items. Easier to implement, but don't see the "big picture" of the list.
    *   **Listwise (ListNet, ListMLE):** Consider the entire list. More complex but can capture global ranking properties.
*   **Embeddings vs. Scores:**
    *   **Contrastive/Triplet:** Often used to learn *embeddings* which can then be used for ranking (e.g., via k-NN or cosine similarity).
    *   **Pairwise Hinge, ListNet, ListMLE, LambdaRank:** Typically operate on or aim to produce relevance *scores*.
*   **Metric Optimization:**
    *   LTR often cares about non-differentiable metrics like NDCG. Methods like **LambdaRank** bridge this gap by defining gradients with respect to these metrics.
*   **No Silver Bullet:** The choice depends on the specific task, data availability (pairs, lists, relevance judgments), computational budget, and primary evaluation metric.
*   Be prepared to discuss trade-offs: complexity, data requirements, directness of metric optimization, and computational cost.

Good luck!
